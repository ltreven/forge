# Forge Product Vision

## Overview

**Forge** is a platform for deploying and operating autonomous AI agent teams with world-class management discipline — structured roles, clear ownership, governed workflows, and real-time health visibility.

The core insight is simple: the same management practices that make great human organizations work — defined roles, process discipline, approval guardrails, measurable output — can now be applied to teams of AI agents. Forge makes that easy.

Forge does not impose a domain. Whether you are building software, running customer support, or coordinating any other team-based function, Forge gives you the infrastructure to deploy autonomous agents that operate like a well-managed organization.

## Core Idea

Forge is a **deployable agent team platform**.

It can be installed into environments controlled by the operator or by the customer. The system makes it easy to:
- define a team structure with clear roles and ownership
- provision and deploy OpenClaw-based agents
- configure team-specific integrations and operating norms
- govern agent behavior through approval workflows and execution boundaries
- observe and manage team health in real time

## Unique Selling Proposition

> *"Forge brings world-class team management discipline to autonomous AI agents — structured roles, clear ownership, approval workflows, and real-time health visibility — so your agent teams run like a well-managed human organization, at AI speed."*

Unlike general-purpose AI tools, Forge is an **operational system**. It treats agent teams as managed entities, not raw tools. Every team has:
- a defined **Team Lead** responsible for coordination and ownership
- role-specific agents with scoped responsibilities
- configurable approval workflows before any consequential action
- persistent memory stored in Git for full restorability
- a live Health Score reflecting team performance and blockers

## Team Templates

Forge uses templates to give teams a strong starting structure without sacrificing flexibility.

### Current Templates

| Template | Description |
|---|---|
| **Forge Starter** | The simplest possible team — just a Team Lead to coordinate work. Ideal for general-purpose or exploratory use. |
| **Engineering** | A full software delivery squad with SDLC discipline: ticket ingestion, technical planning, implementation, testing, and PR submission. |
| **Customer Support** | *(Coming soon)* An automated support team for handling tickets, routing issues, and maintaining customer SLAs. |

Templates are a starting point. Teams can always evolve their composition over time.

## Who It Is For

### Current user
- Lourenço, acting as the initial operator, architect, and consultant

### Future users
- Consultants deploying agent systems for clients
- Technical operators responsible for customer-specific agent environments
- Organizations that want structured, governed AI teams in any business function

## Problem Statement

Organizations trying to adopt AI agents run into recurring problems:

- deployments are ad hoc and hard to reproduce
- agents are not packaged as operational infrastructure
- roles and ownership are undefined — agents act without clear accountability
- approval boundaries are unclear or absent
- observability and health monitoring are afterthoughts
- environment-specific integrations are hard to configure cleanly

There is a gap between a useful AI agent and a deployable, governed agent team that an organization can actually trust and operate.

## Value Proposition

Forge bridges that gap by providing:
- a clear **team structure model** with defined roles and a required Team Lead
- **repeatable deployment patterns** for any agent team
- **approval-aware workflows** — agents never act externally without explicit sign-off
- **real-time health visibility** — velocity, blockers, and activity tracked continuously
- **portability** across local, Docker, and Kubernetes environments
- **vertical templates** for common team archetypes (Engineering, Customer Support, and more)

## Strategic Positioning

Forge is an **agent team management platform**, not just a single AI developer container.

Its differentiation comes from treating agent teams as operational units that can be:
- provisioned with a defined structure
- configured per customer or use case
- governed through approval workflows
- monitored via a live Health Score
- scaled or restructured as needs evolve
- restored from zero using Git-persisted state

## Product Principles

1. **Team structure first**
   - Every team needs a minimum viable structure: at least one Team Lead with clear ownership.

2. **Human approval remains central**
   - Agents may assist aggressively, but they do not act externally without explicit human sign-off where required.

3. **Portable by design**
   - The same team model works locally, in Docker, and in Kubernetes.

4. **Customer-specific configuration**
   - Integrations, policies, and team composition are driven by environment-specific configuration, not hardcoded assumptions.

5. **Infrastructure as product surface**
   - Helm charts, Terraform, scripts, and future operators are first-class product components.

6. **Domain-agnostic by default, vertical-ready by design**
   - Forge works for any team type out of the box. Vertical templates (Engineering, Customer Support) provide opinionated starting points without limiting the platform's scope.

## Product Direction

### Near term
- Support Forge Starter, Engineering, and Customer Support templates
- Simplify onboarding so any team can get started in minutes
- Establish the Team Lead as the universal ownership primitive
- Document the operating model and approval expectations

### Mid term
- Package the system for Kubernetes deployment with Helm
- Introduce observability for multi-team workspaces
- Support additional agent roles and team topologies
- Add deeper integration options per vertical

### Long term
- Provision infrastructure automatically with Terraform
- Add Kubernetes operators for health monitoring and team performance insights
- Support multi-customer deployment patterns
- Extend the template library with new verticals

## What Forge Is Not

At least for now, Forge is not:
- a generic chatbot product
- a hosted multi-tenant SaaS
- a replacement for human leadership
- an autonomous system allowed to perform unrestricted external actions
