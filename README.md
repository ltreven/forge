> **Deployment convention:** each app that runs on Kubernetes will have its Dockerfile and Helm chart under a `deploy/` subfolder (e.g., `apps/web/deploy/`, `apps/forge-api/deploy/`). ArgoCD will point to those paths per environment.

**Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 16, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, i18n (EN + ZH)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, JWT auth (bcryptjs)
- **Agents:** OpenClaw, containerized via Docker/Kubernetes, deployed via Helm
- **Integrations:** Linear (Engineering template)

## Architecture overview

Forge separates the platform into two distinct planes:

- **Control Plane (`admin-api` + `admin-web`):** Global SaaS layer. Manages users, workspaces, billing, and marketing. Runs in the `forge-admin` namespace.
- **Application Plane (`forge-api` + `forge-web`):** Tenant execution layer. Manages teams, agents, and tasks for specific workspaces. Runs in the `forge` namespace.

---

## Multi-tenant model

Forge uses a **Cell-based Architecture** for maximum tenant isolation:

- **Shared SaaS Layer:** Shared deployments of `apps/admin-web` and `apps/admin-api` (Control Plane).
- **Tenant Cells:** Each workspace runs its own agent team in an isolated Kubernetes namespace (`forge-ws-*`), consuming the Application Plane (`forge-api` + `forge-web`).
- **Regional Scaling:** The Application Plane and agents can be deployed in different regions to stay close to the customer data.

---

## Team Templates

| Template | Description |
|---|---|
| **Forge Starter** | Minimal team — Team Lead only. General-purpose or exploratory use. |
| **Engineering** | Full software delivery squad with SDLC discipline (Engineer, Architect, PM). |
| **Customer Support** | *(Coming soon)* Automated support team. |

Every team requires at least a **Team Lead** — the ownership and coordination primitive.

---

## Running locally

The entire stack (Web, API, PostgreSQL) runs inside local Kubernetes via **Tilt**. One command starts everything.

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled *(Settings → Kubernetes → Enable Kubernetes)*
- [Tilt](https://tilt.dev): `brew install tilt`
- Helm v3+: `brew install helm`

### First-time setup

```bash
# 1. Configure the API environment
cp apps/forge-api/.env.example apps/forge-api/.env
# Edit apps/forge-api/.env and set JWT_SECRET to any local secret
```

### Start the stack

```bash
# Switch context to Docker Desktop if you use multiple clusters
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop

# Start everything — builds images, deploys to local k8s, watches for changes
tilt up
```

The Tilt dashboard opens automatically at **http://localhost:10350**. Wait for all resources to go green.

When done:
```bash
tilt down
```

---

## Testing the onboarding flow

Once the stack is running:

1. **`/signup`** — Create an account (3 steps):
   - Step 1: Full name + work email + password
   - Step 2: Workspace name
   - Step 3: Choose a team template (Forge Starter or Engineering)
     - **Forge Starter:** Team name + Team Lead name → creates team → goes to `/teams`
     - **Engineering:** Team name + agent squad (Engineer / Architect / PM) → goes to `/teams`

2. **`/teams`** — Your agent team dashboard after onboarding

3. **`/login`** — Sign back in with the credentials you created

> **Note:** SSO (Google / Microsoft) is UI-only in the current MVP — clicking the buttons shows a "Coming soon" toast. Real OAuth support is a future ticket.

## 🚀 Local Kubernetes development (Tilt + Docker Desktop)

This is the recommended workflow to develop and test the full stack (Web + API + PostgreSQL) locally inside Kubernetes, mirroring the production environment.

### One-time setup (do once, ever)

```bash
# 1. Enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop
#    Docker Desktop → Settings → Kubernetes → Enable Kubernetes → Apply

# 2. Install Tilt
brew install tilt

# 3. Confirm Helm is in your PATH (add to ~/.zshrc if needed)
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
helm version --short   # should show v3.x or v4.x
```

### Daily workflow

```bash
# 1. Switch kubectl context to Docker Desktop (only needed if you use multiple clusters)
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop

# 2. Start everything (builds images, deploys to local k8s, opens dashboard)
cd /path/to/forge
tilt up

# 3. Open the Tilt dashboard (auto-opens, or navigate manually)
open http://localhost:10350

# 4. When done for the day — stop Tilt and remove cluster resources
tilt down
```

> **Context tip:** Docker Desktop persists the `docker-desktop` Kubernetes context permanently. You only need `kubectl config use-context docker-desktop` if you've been working with another cluster (e.g., a cloud cluster) and need to switch back.

### Navigating the database (Drizzle Studio)

Drizzle ships a local web GUI — **Drizzle Studio** — that lets you browse tables, run queries, and inspect data without needing a SQL client.

```bash
# Open Drizzle Studio (runs against the local k8s PostgreSQL via port-forward)
cd apps/forge-api
pnpm drizzle-kit studio
```

This starts the studio at **https://local.drizzle.studio** and opens it in your browser automatically.

> **Note:** The `DATABASE_URL` in `apps/forge-api/.env` must point to the running database. When using Tilt, PostgreSQL is port-forwarded to `localhost:5432` automatically, so no changes are needed.

Alternatively, connect to the database directly via `psql`:

```bash
# Interactive psql session inside the running pod
kubectl exec -n forge statefulset/forge-postgresql -- psql -U forge -d forge
```

### What Tilt does automatically

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| Detects file changes | Syncs changed files directly into running pods (live_update) |
| `apps/forge-api/src/**` changed | TypeScript recompiled inside pod → API restarts in ~3s |
| `apps/web/app/**` changed | Files synced → Next.js HMR picks it up in ~2s |
| `charts/forge/**` changed | Rerenders Helm templates → applies diff to cluster |
| `apps/forge-api/Dockerfile` changed | Full image rebuild → redeploy |

### Accessing the services

| Service | URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Web** | http://forge.localhost | via Ingress (NGINX) |
| **Web** (direct) | http://localhost:3000 | via Tilt port-forward |
| **API health** | http://localhost:4000/health | Application Plane |
| **Admin API health** | http://localhost:4001/health | Control Plane |
| **PostgreSQL** | `localhost:5432` | user: `forge` / DBs: `forge`, `forge_admin` |
| **Tilt dashboard** | http://localhost:10350 | logs, status, live_update |

### Troubleshooting commands

```bash
# --- Pod status ---
kubectl get pods -A | grep forge                     # list all forge pods across namespaces

# --- Logs ---
kubectl logs -n forge-admin deployment/forge-admin-api -f  # Admin API logs
kubectl logs -n forge deployment/forge-api -f              # Forge API logs
kubectl logs -n forge deployment/forge-web -f              # Web logs
kubectl logs -n forge statefulset/forge-postgresql -f      # PostgreSQL logs

# --- Connect to PostgreSQL (for manual queries) ---
kubectl exec -n forge statefulset/forge-postgresql -- \
  psql -U forge -d forge
kubectl exec -n forge statefulset/forge-postgresql -- \
  psql -U forge -d forge_admin
```
# --- Force a pod restart without full rebuild ---
kubectl rollout restart -n forge deployment/forge-api
kubectl rollout restart -n forge deployment/forge-web

# --- Check ingress ---
kubectl get ingress -n forge
kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx

# --- Nuclear option: full reset ---
tilt down && tilt up
# Or wipe the namespace entirely (DB data will be lost):
kubectl delete namespace forge
tilt up
```

### Chart management

```bash
# Lint the Helm chart (all environments)
make k8s-lint

# Render templates as YAML (dry-run — useful for debugging)
make k8s-render

# Lint only
helm lint charts/forge -f charts/forge/values-local.yaml
```

### Architecture in local mode

```
Your browser
     │
     ▼
forge.localhost (port 80)
     │  NGINX Ingress (ingress-nginx namespace)
     ├── /api/* ──▶ forge-web (proxy to forge-forge-api:4000)
     └── /      ──▶ forge-web:3000
     
  (Development Port-forwards)
  localhost:4000  ──▶ forge-api (Application Plane, forge ns)
  localhost:4001  ──▶ forge-admin-api (Control Plane, forge-admin ns)
  localhost:5432  ──▶ forge-postgresql (DB: forge, forge_admin)
```

The API has **no Ingress rule** — it is only reachable from within the cluster (from the web pod). This mirrors the production security model.



Agents are deployed as containerized OpenClaw instances via the Helm chart in `apps/agents/helm/`.

```bash
# Quick test deployment (reads credentials from .env)
make agents-test
```

The Helm chart supports:
- Configurable agent profile, model provider, and model name
- Linear MCP integration (enabled via values, Engineering template)
- Telegram bot token for agent communication
- Non-privileged container execution
- One namespace per customer tenant (multi-tenant isolation)

See `apps/agents/helm/values.yaml` for the full configuration reference.

## Engineering principles

- **Secrets out of Git.** All credentials via environment variables only.
- **English everywhere.** Code, comments, commits, ADRs — always in English.
- **Approval-aware.** Agents never take external actions without explicit human sign-off.
- **Portable by default.** State persists in Git; any environment can be restored from zero.
- **Strict SDLC.** Every task: ticket intake → DoR check → tech planning → implementation → tests → PR.
